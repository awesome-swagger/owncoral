# chakra

Themes for Chakra, mirroring [Chakra source repo structure](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/blob/main/packages/theme/src/).


## On style

We've implemented some aspects of [Material Design](https://material.io/design),
namely [Typography](../typographyStyles.tsx) and [colors](foundations/colors.tsx).

We went a bit overboard on the colors and generated our own
[perceptually uniform palettes](https://observablehq.com/d/9156fe7f1051dca3) (using the OKLab 
color space).


## Usage

Most new Chakra components that you use will need a slight bit of tweaking. If you use a new
component for the first time and don't see it customized here, consider doing so.
